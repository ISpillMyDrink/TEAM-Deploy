## üíæ Setup

To start using TEAM-Deploy clone or download the repository and populate the `Images` folder with your WIM or ESD files, the `Answerfiles` folder with your <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/wsim/answer-files-overview">Answerfiles</a>, `Associationfiles` folder with your <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/export-or-import-default-application-associations">Associationfiles</a> and the `Packages` folder with your <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/siloed-provisioning-packages">Siloed provisioning packages</a>.

Note that no path should contain spaces, that includes the path to the repository itself aswell as the names of the image, answerfile, associationfile, and provisioning package files.

Not all versions of DISM support applying Siloed provisioning packages. If you want to use provisioning packages you should use the latest version of DISM from the Windows ADK and set the `adkLocation` option in the `TEAM-Deploy.cfg` file to the location of the ADK installation.

## üìã Usage

Execute `TEAM-Deploy.cmd` with administrative privileges and use the menu to select the disk, image, answerfile, association file and provisioning package to be used. The script will then format the disk, write the partition table, copy the image to the disk and apply the answerfile, association file and provisioning package. Finally it will create the bootloader.

Partitioning, imaging, answerfile deployment, association file deployment and provisioning package deployment can all be enabled/disabled independently.

## üìù Configuration

The `TEAM-Deploy.cfg` file contains the configuration for TEAM-Deploy. The following options are available:
