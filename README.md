## üíæ Setup

To start using TEAM-Deploy clone or download the repository and populate the `Images` folder with your WIM or ESD files, the `Answerfiles` folder with your answerfiles, `Associationfiles` folder with your association files and the
`Packages` folder with your siloed provisioning packages.

## üìã Usage

Execute `TEAM-Deploy.cmd` with administrative privileges and use the menu to select the disk, image, answerfile, association file and provisioning package to be used. The script will then format the disk, write the partition table, copy the image to the disk and apply the answerfile, association file and provisioning package. Finally it will create the bootloader.

Partitioning, imaging, answerfile deployment, association file deployment and provisioning package deployment can all be enabled/disabled independently.
